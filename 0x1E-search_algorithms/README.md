# SEARCH ALGORITHM

A search algorithm is a method for finding a particular item or group of items with specific properties within a collection of items. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used in various applications such as databases, information retrieval systems, artificial intelligence, and more. The primary goal of a search algorithm is to locate the target item as efficiently as possible, minimizing the time and computational resources required.

## Categories of Search Algorithms
### 1. Uninformed Search (Blind Search):
These algorithms do not have additional information about the target's location other than the data structure's information.
Examples: Linear Search, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).

### 2. Informed Search (Heuristic Search):
These algorithms use additional information (heuristics) to find the target more efficiently.
Examples: Binary Search, A* Search Algorithm.
